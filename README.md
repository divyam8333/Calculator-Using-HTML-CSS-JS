# Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-JS

This project is a visually appealing digital calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator design mimics a real-life device with a modern and sleek interface on a chalkboard background, adding a unique, educational vibe. The project allows users to perform advance arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Features:

a) Interface Design: The calculator has a minimalist and intuitive layout. The buttons are styled with rounded edges, featuring black and green color themes for functional keys like "AC" (All Clear), "DEL" (Delete), and "=" (Equals), giving it a cohesive and professional look.

b) Background Theme: The chalkboard background with a piece of chalk adds a classroom or blackboard feel, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and emphasizing the calculator's purpose as a learning tool.

c) Functionality: JavaScript enables real-time calculations, allowing the user to click on buttons and see results displayed instantly in the calculator screen area.

d) Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to avoid calculation errors like division by zero.

This project demonstrates a good grasp of frontend development concepts, combining functionality with an attractive and unique design, making it both practical and visually engaging.
